NAME
    RT-Extension-NotifySlack - RT ScripAction Slack integration

DESCRIPTION
    This extension allows for Slack updates to be sent out in the same
    manner that emails are dispatched. Meaning that a on any condition a
    Slack action can be called and a Slack specififc template can be used to
    update a Slack channel.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.4

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    make initdb
        See the CONFIGURATION section below before running this command.

        Only run this the first time you install this module.

        If you run this twice, you may end up with duplicate data in your
        database.

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::NotifySlack');

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

CONFIGURATION
    You must add the desired Slack channels and webhook URLs to the RT
    %SlackWebHookUrls config value in RT_SiteConfig.pm. These values can be
    retrieved from the Slack API's Incoming Webhooks configuration settings.
    See example below:

        Set( %SlackWebHookUrls,
            '#channel' => 'https://myslackwebhookurl...',
        );

    The 'Notify Slack' ScripAction posts to one Slack channel. The default
    Slack channel is currently set to #general. You can update this in the
    initialdata file by changing the 'Notify Slack' ScripAction Argument to
    the desired Slack channel ( be sure to include the '#' when indicating
    the channel name and no '#' for direct messaging ). To post to
    additional Slack channels, copy the ScripAction giving it a new Name and
    Argument, something like "Slack Updates To #Support".
